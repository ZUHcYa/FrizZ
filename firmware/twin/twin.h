/** @file twin.h
 *  @brief The virtual CHOMPI: FRIZZ's own firmware (chompi_main.cpp and everything under it,
 *  libDaisy's UI, Switch, 4021 and MIDI code) running on the host against a simulated board.
 *
 *  Time only moves in Run(): each 0.5 ms block runs the audio callback, then main() (a
 *  coroutine) until it has used up the block. Everything is deterministic: the same inputs at
 *  the same times give the same samples and LEDs.
 *
 *  Power-on is Boot(); there is one power cycle per process (the firmware's globals are
 *  constructed once), so a test that needs a fresh device runs a fresh process.
