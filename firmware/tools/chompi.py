"""chompi.py: where the CHOMPI on USB is, and getting it from there to where it's wanted.

It is in one of four states, as the computer sees it:

    frizz      FRIZZ, which answers its own SysEx (code/src/MidiControl.h)
    launcher   the multi-firmware launcher's picker, which answers its PING
    storage    the USB storage firmware: the card is a drive labelled CHOMPI-SD
    other      a CHOMPI MIDI device that is neither (an older FRIZZ, TAPE, ...)

and None for nothing on USB. Every way between them goes through the launcher: FRIZZ restarts
into it on its SysEx F0 7D 43 48 10 F7 (MidiClock.h), the storage firmware on an eject, and
the launcher starts a slot on its RUN (05). Launchers and storage firmwares from before those
two need a hand instead, and this says which.

Which slot runs, no firmware says: FRIZZ on 10 and FRIZZ-TEST on 12 answer alike, and so does
the bench (FRIZZ-bench.bin, 11), whose load reads 0. So the tools note the slot they last
started (RUNNING, beside the lock: run(), flash.py) and to_frizz() goes by it: the FRIZZ
running if no slot is asked for, else the one asked for, started unless it's the one noted;
the bench is never taken for FRIZZ. A slot started by hand isn't noted: `hold` without a
command (playing by hand) forgets the note.

One process at a time has the CHOMPI: the first time a tool reaches for it (state(), a link
to it, a restart), it takes a lock (LOCK, flock) for the process's life, and waits, saying who
has it, while another holds it; what doesn't touch the CHOMPI (measure.py compare) never
waits. A tool started by one that holds it (FRIZZ_CHOMPI_HELD set) shares it; one that talks
to the twin, not the CHOMPI (test/remote.cpp), sets it too. To keep the CHOMPI over several
tools, or for playing it by hand:

    tools/chompi.py hold                 holds it until Ctrl-C
    tools/chompi.py hold CMD ARGS...     holds it while CMD runs (sh -c for a sequence)
