"""builds.py: FRIZZ's two builds and their md5, the name a build goes by.

    tools/builds.py              builds both (make, make BENCH=1 in code/src, GCC 10.3), prints their md5
    tools/builds.py md5          prints the md5 of the builds there are, building nothing
    tools/builds.py cpu [FILE]   files the bench's cpu.txt (default card/cpu.txt, from card.py get)
                                 as bin/cpu.txt, headed by the md5 of the build it measured

The builds aren't in git: they live in code/src/build/FRIZZ.bin and
code/src/build-bench/FRIZZ-bench.bin, and their md5 names them in a pull request, a cpu.txt
and a release's notes. That works because GCC 10.3-2021.10 builds the same source to the
same bytes, on any machine (README.md, 1. Toolchain); another compiler gives other bytes, so
builds here refuse it.

cpu.txt's first line is the bench's own: the checksum of the source it was built from, which
the bench build also carries. `cpu` files it only if the bench build here carries that line
and the source still has that checksum, so the md5 it adds is that of the build measured.
It warns when a build is older than the source, and flash.py --no-build refuses to send one. Python 3 without packages; it doesn't touch
the CHOMPI (flash.py does).
