/** @file FxOutput.h
 *  @brief Page 2's knobs every effect shares, on the same knobs for each, so they're found
 *  without looking (FxParams.h): knob 1 Mix, knob 3 Band, knob 4 Level. FxChain.h wraps each
 *  insert in one; the sends use only its Band, on what goes into them.
 *
 *  - Mix: the dry signal against the effect's, 0 dry to 1 (the default) fully the effect's.
 *  - Band: which part of the spectrum the effect works on. In the middle (the default) all of
 *    it; turned left, only the lows, below a crossover that falls from 20kHz to 40Hz; turned
 *    right, only the highs, above one that rises from 20Hz to 8kHz. The rest passes dry. Two
 *    one-pole lowpasses: the effect gets the difference of the two, the rest is the signal
 *    minus that, so with the effect neutral the two add up to the signal exactly.
 *  - Level: the effect's output, not the dry signal Mix blends in: mute at 0, then -36dB to
 *    +12dB, 0dB at 3/4 (the default).
 *
 *  Nothing here adjusts itself: what comes out is what the knobs say. The key's fade (the
 *  effect's FxGate) applies to Mix and Level as to the effect, so an effect that's off is
 *  untouched by them, and at their defaults the effect runs exactly as without them.
