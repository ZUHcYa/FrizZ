/** @file PlayKeys.h
 *  @brief What the play page does with the CHOMPI, PLAY and LOOP keys, without the hardware.
 *  NormalPage.h routes the keys here; test/keys.cpp runs it on the host.
 *
 *  CHOMPI held is SHIFT. In a scene mode with a slot picked (SceneArmed), a tap of it
 *  confirms: on its release, and only if nothing else was pressed or turned while it was
 *  held, so holding it still works as SHIFT there. An FX key held, then SHIFT, latches it, and
 *  SHIFT, then an FX key, selects it (FxControls.h): both are SHIFT combos, so the release
 *  doesn't confirm. SHIFT + anything else is that combo, and a latch the SHIFT press had
 *  queued for a held FX key is dropped (ShiftUsed).
 *
 *  LOOP acts on press, so recording starts, stops and erases exactly then. The gestures that
 *  record on an empty looper erase a loop: LOOP at once, PLAY held + LOOP at the loop's end
 *  (quantized). LOOP while that waits erases at once; PLAY alone takes it back. For
 *  kEraseLockMs after LOOP stopped a recording, LOOP doesn't erase, so a double press or a
 *  bounce can't lose the new loop. PLAY acts on release, and only if nothing combined with it
 *  during the hold, so the PLAY + LOOP combos never also toggle play. SHIFT + LOOP is tap
 *  tempo and only that; SHIFT + PLAY stops a scene morph, or without one is PLAY. A release
 *  whose press wasn't seen (a key held through the boot animation) does nothing.
 *
 *  Host is NormalPage on the device, a fake on the host. It needs: SceneArmed(),
 *  ConfirmScene(), ShiftPressed() (true if it queued a latch) and ShiftUsed() (FxControls'),
 *  FreezeMorph() (true if one was stopped), Tap(), Refused() (LOOP can't do it), Now() in ms,
 *  and the looper's LooperState(), CanRecordQuantized(), StartRecording(quantized),
 *  StopRecording(), TogglePlay(), Erase(), EraseAtEnd(), CancelErase(), ErasePending().
