/** @file MidiOut.h
 *  @brief MIDI clock, Start, Stop, Continue and Song Position out of the MIDI jack, and over
 *  USB if asked (the settings page's upper D#, MANUAL.md "MIDI out"; decided in #60). Off at
 *  first: then nothing goes out.
 *
 *  While it's on, the clock always runs, at the tempo FRIZZ thinks in, the beat on the
 *  settings page's G#; whether the gear behind plays is up to Start, Continue and Stop.
 *  - Passing on: with a MIDI clock coming in and no loop, its ticks go out as MidiClock counts
 *    them, so by the clock factor: at half every other one, at double one more halfway to the
 *    next, timed by the clock's period. Start, Continue and Stop from that input go out too.
 *  - Generating: with a loop, or without a clock, two ticks per pulse of the tempo clock
 *    (TempoClock.h, 12 PPQN), one on the pulse and one halfway to the next. With a loop they
 *    come from its play position, so beat 1 is the loop's start, at its speed (in reverse the
 *    clock runs on: it can't count down); paused, its grid runs on by itself.
 *  With a loop, the transport is the loop's, and nothing that comes in is passed on:
 *  - a new loop starting to play sends Start with its first tick, unless the gear already
 *    plays from a Start passed on: the ticks then just carry on (a quantized loop starts on
 *    the clock's bar line, and a Start would throw longer patterns back to their bar 1);
 *  - a pause sends Stop; playing on sends Song Position at the next 16th right away, then
 *    Continue with that 16th's tick, so gear that ignores Song Position resumes in step too.
 *  Erasing the loop sends nothing: the out passes the incoming clock on again, or runs on at
 *  the loop's tempo.
 *
 *  Never back where a clock comes from: while passing on, nothing goes out of the input it
 *  comes in on (the sender leads; a soft thru would feed FRIZZ its own ticks). Generating,
 *  everything goes to every port the setting has.
 *
 *  The jack's bytes go to the UART from the audio callback without waiting
 *  (MidiClock::TrsPut): a ring of them, drained as the UART takes them, two at once, then one
 *  every 0.32 ms. USB's are sent by MainLoop (FlushUsb), between the answers to queries,
 *  which keeps them out of a SysEx; while MainLoop writes the card (a scene saved), they wait,
 *  so USB's ticks can bunch up then.
