/** @file FxParams.h
 *  @brief The punch-in FX's knobs: one entry per FxId (FxChain.h), in the same order, with
 *  which knobs each uses on its two pages, their defaults, which are stepped and their coarse grids for SHIFT +
 *  turn. No hardware here, so the play page's logic (FxControls.h) can be tested on the host.
 *  The keys, LEDs and colours that go with each FX are in FxSlots.h.
 *
 *  Every effect's knobs follow one pattern, so they're guessable without labels: knob 1 is the
 *  main control, 2 feedback (or resonance), 3 tone or colour, 4 stereo or level. An effect
 *  without one of these puts its odd parameter there. Page 2 (parameters 4-7, a knob press
 *  away, FxControls.h) is laid out the same on every effect too (FxOutput.h): knob 1 Mix, knob
 *  2 a parameter of the effect's own (#40), knob 3 Band, knob 4 Level. The sends have freeze,
 *  their own, Band and ducking there (their level is page 1's knob 4), the resonator its env
 *  mod, Band into its loop and its return's level. Page 1's knob 4 is stereo on every insert
 *  but the tape stop (its depth). The compressor's page 2 has Mix, a sidechain highpass and
 *  Makeup on the knobs of Mix, Band and Level.
 *
 *  The defaults leave every effect silent or nearly so: the knob that brings it in (shift,
 *  drive, rate and bits, cutoff, amount, feedback, wow and flutter, level) starts neutral, the
 *  others where they sound good, so one turn brings the effect in. The freezer and slicer
 *  can't be neutral: they start at their most transparent setting. Nor can the tape stop:
 *  every press stops the tape.
