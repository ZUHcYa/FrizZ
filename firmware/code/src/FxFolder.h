/** A wavefolder in the Buchla / Serge manner: the signal is driven past the fold points and
 *  mirrored back, each fold adding harmonics. The fold is a sine (smooth, the classic
 *  Buchla shape) crossfaded into a triangle (sharp, brighter), with the symmetry adding a
 *  bias so the folds go uneven and bring in even harmonics.
 *
 *  DaisySP's Wavefolder is the triangle alone, unfiltered; here the fold is antialiased
 *  with first-order ADAA (the fold's antiderivative, differenced), DC-blocked, and followed
 *  by a lowpass. The sine fold barely aliases anyway; on the triangle the ADAA takes off
 *  5-13dB, which at high drive on bright material still leaves some grit. The sine's and the
 *  triangle's antiderivatives are kept apart and blended with the current shape, so moving
 *  the shape knob doesn't put its change into the difference. The fold is scaled to a slope
 *  of 1 at 0 (2/pi for the sine, 1 for the triangle, blended with the shape), so at 1x a
 *  quiet signal comes out at its own level whatever the shape; driven harder, the output stays near
 *  full scale whatever goes in, and page 2's Level (FxOutput.h) sets how loud that is. Nothing
 *  follows the input's level. Fully wet while on (page 2's Mix blends in the dry signal).
 *  Params: 0 drive, 1 shape (sine to triangle), 2 tone, 3 symmetry. */
