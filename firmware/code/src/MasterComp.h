/** @file MasterComp.h
 *  @brief The master compressor: always on, after the punch-in FX and before the output gain
 *  (passthroughEngine.h), so VOLUME doesn't change how hard it works. Its knobs are edited like
 *  an FX's from its own key (FxControls.h, kCompParams in FxParams.h) and kept on the card
 *  (MasterSettings.h), not in the scenes.
 *
 *  One stereo-linked detector, the louder channel's peak, so the image doesn't shift, held for
 *  kHoldMs so a fast attack doesn't follow a bass note's waveform (crackle). Above the
 *  threshold, the gain falls by the ratio, with a soft knee. The reduction is smoothed in dB,
 *  so the release recovers evenly however deep it went. The reference is a signal of 1.0 at
 *  this point, about a hot line input at the default input gain. A plain compressor: the
 *  makeup is a knob, nothing turns anything up by itself.
 *
 *  Knobs, each 0..1, on two pages as an FX's (page 2's Mix and Makeup on the knobs an FX has
 *  its Mix and Level on, FxOutput.h):
 *   0 threshold: 0dB down to -30dB. 0 is off: with the makeup at 0 too, an exact bypass
 *   1 ratio: 1.5:1 to 20:1, 4:1 in the middle
 *   2 attack: 1-30ms (time constant)
 *   3 release: 40-600ms (time constant)
 *   4 mix: dry to fully compressed, for parallel compression
 *   6 sidechain highpass: what the detector hears, off (0) or from 20Hz up to 500Hz, so the
 *     bass doesn't pump the rest (page 2's knob 3, where an FX has its Band)
 *   7 makeup: 0dB to +24dB
 *
 *  The safety limiter after the output gain is the old master compressor at its lowest
 *  setting (limiter.h); this is in front of it.
