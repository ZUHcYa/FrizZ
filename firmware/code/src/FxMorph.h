/** @file FxMorph.h
 *  @brief A scene morph (SHIFT + scene key): the FX glide from where they are to a scene and
 *  land on a bar line of the FX's clock (TempoClock.h), the first one ahead, or one more per
 *  AddBar. FxControls::Morph works out what each parameter and key does (FxMorphPlan); this
 *  runs it in the audio callback, between the UI and the FxChain, so the landing is exact to
 *  the clock pulse.
 *
 *  Held (SHIFT still down after the tap, Start's hold): nothing moves and the bar lines don't
 *  count, however long it's held; taps add bars. Release glides from where the sound still is
 *  to the next bar line from there, plus the bars tapped.
 *
 *  The glide follows the clock: the pulses counted since the start, plus the time since the
 *  last one, over the pulses expected to the landing. The landing itself is the bar line's
 *  pulse, wherever the transport went, so a wrong estimate only bends the glide. Glided
 *  values are sent once per block and slewed at the fast slew (FxChain::FastSlew), so the
 *  sound follows the glide closely instead of trailing it by the knobs' 100ms.
 *
 *  While it runs it owns every parameter: the UI's SetParam moves the parameter's
 *  destination, not the sound. An FX whose key it switches at the landing (or when its fade-in
 *  starts) is deferred: the UI's SetOn only says what it will be.
 *
 *  The crossfader (#66): Fader takes the glide out of the clock's hands into the UI's, 0 the
 *  start (A) and 1 the target (B), back and forth, and the bar lines no longer count. What
 *  glides follows the fader; a fade-in's key is on anywhere past A, a fade-out's until B; the
 *  rest switches in the middle, both ways: the stepped values of an FX on in both, and the
 *  keys of the FX without fade knobs. It ends as a morph does: Land (B), Freeze (where it
 *  is), or Freeze at A, which the UI takes back to where it was (FxControls::EndFade).
