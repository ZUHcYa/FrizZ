/** @file SceneStore.h
 *  @brief The FX scenes (FxScenes.h) and their file on the SD card, frizz_scenes.txt in the
 *  current directory, /FRIZZ (EnterFrizzDir), or the root if that can't be made. Read once at
 *  boot; written only when the play page saves, copies or deletes one, never on a recall, so a
 *  performance doesn't touch the card.
 *
 *  Next to it, frizz_master.txt holds the master compressor's knobs, the mono input and the
 *  MIDI settings (MasterSettings.h): read at boot, written when the play page asks, a while after they were
 *  last turned. It goes through the same .tmp; one that can't be read is simply replaced, it
 *  holds little.
 *
 *  The write runs in MainLoop (Process), not in the button handler: the audio callback runs
 *  the UI during boot. It goes to frizz_scenes.tmp first, which then replaces the old file,
 *  so a power cut mid-write leaves one or the other. Reading falls back to the .tmp, and
 *  then finishes that save, so the next one doesn't overwrite the only good copy. A file that
 *  is there but can't be read (another version, edited into something else) isn't
 *  overwritten: the next save moves it to frizz_scenes.bak first.
 *
 *  Without a card the scenes still work, in RAM only, and are gone at power-off. A write that
 *  fails is reported (GetSaveState); the next save mounts the card again and tries again, so
 *  a card put in or back meanwhile is used.
 *
 *  A card first mounted after boot (LateCard) is read before anything is written to it: its
 *  scenes fill the slots still empty in RAM. If one of its scenes would be overwritten, or
 *  its file can't be read, the file goes to frizz_scenes.bak first, as an unreadable one does
 *  at boot. Its master settings would change the sound mid-session, so the ones in RAM stay
 *  and the card's file is kept as frizz_master.bak.
