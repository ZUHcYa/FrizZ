# Installing FRIZZ

FRIZZ installs from the SD card, the same way as any CHOMPI firmware update. You don't need any
tools or drivers, and the CHOMPI's bootloader is never touched.

## What you need

- A CHOMPI. It doesn't matter which firmware it runs now (TAPE, TEMPO or WAVE).
- Its microSD card, or any FAT32-formatted microSD card.
- A computer with a card reader.
- `FRIZZ.bin`. Download it from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ZUHcYa/FrizZ/releases),
  or build it yourself as described in [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md).

## Install

1. **Back up the card.** Copy everything on it to your computer: your samples, `presets.json`
   and `options.json`. FRIZZ doesn't touch them, but you'll want them if you go back.
2. **Remove the old firmware.** Delete every `.bin` file in the top folder of the card, for
   example `CHOMPI_TAPEv2_0.bin`. There must be exactly one `.bin` on the card. Everything else
   can stay.
3. **Copy `FRIZZ.bin`** to the top folder of the card, not into a subfolder.
4. **Eject the card** properly, put it in the CHOMPI and switch it on.
5. **Wait.** A slow rainbow LED pattern means the CHOMPI is writing FRIZZ into its memory.
   Don't switch it off while that runs. FRIZZ starts by itself when it's done.

Leave the card in: FRIZZ keeps its FX scenes on it, in `FRIZZ/frizz_scenes.txt`, and its
master settings (compressor, mono input, MIDI) in `FRIZZ/frizz_master.txt`; the `.bak` files
next to them are the previous versions, and `bug-N.txt` are [bug reports](MANUAL.md#bug-reports). FRIZZ
creates the `FRIZZ` folder the first time it starts, and moves a `frizz_scenes.txt` an older
FRIZZ left in the top folder into it. Without a card FRIZZ still runs, but scenes you save are
gone at power-off. A later FRIZZ update keeps your scenes as long as that folder stays on the
card.

## Check that it works

1. Plug a stereo source into the **AUX input**, and headphones or a mixer into the outputs.
   (FRIZZ doesn't use the built-in microphone.)
2. Turn the **VOLUME** knob. You should hear your source, and the VOLUME LED moves with the level.

If you hear nothing, press VOLUME once and turn it to raise the input gain. Press it twice more
to get back to output volume. The [quick guide](QUICKSTART.md) takes it from here.

## Updating FRIZZ

Same as installing: replace `FRIZZ.bin` on the card with the new one and switch on.

## With the multi-firmware launcher

The [multi-firmware launcher](https://github.com/sfaber02/CHOMPI-MULTI-FIRMWARE/releases)
(a community project by hiwatts, chomplex music theory and lnetzel) keeps several firmwares on
one card: at power-on each key with a firmware lights up, and pressing one starts it. FRIZZ
works as one of them, next to TAPE, TEMPO and WAVE.

1. **Set up the card with the launcher**, as its
   [v1.5 release](https://github.com/sfaber02/CHOMPI-MULTI-FIRMWARE/releases/tag/launcher-v1.5)
   describes: copy the contents of `chompi-multi-firmware-card/` to an empty FAT32 card and
   switch on (a rainbow once, then the picker). On a card with an older launcher (v1.1 or
   later), the setup page below updates it.
2. **Put FRIZZ on a key with the [setup page](https://ugrossek.github.io/CHOMPI/setup/).**
   With the picker showing, connect the CHOMPI to a computer over USB and open the page in
   Chrome or Edge. Pick FRIZZ for a free key; the page fetches the latest release and writes
   it to the card.

   **Or by hand:** copy `FRIZZ.bin` into the card's `FIRMWARE` folder, named after the key you
   want it on, for example `FIRMWARE/04_FRIZZ.bin` for key 4.
3. Copy your `FRIZZ` folder over too, if you have scenes from another card. Otherwise FRIZZ
   creates it on its first start and keeps its scenes there, apart from the other firmwares'
   files.

With the launcher, the CHOMPI goes back to its picker every time you switch it on. To update
FRIZZ, pick it again on the setup page, or copy the new `FRIZZ.bin` over the old
`FIRMWARE/04_FRIZZ.bin`; no rainbow pattern, since the launcher stays installed. The setup
page offers releases only: a test build (a pre-release on the Releases page) goes on by hand.

The launcher's key 15 is a USB storage mode: the card shows up on the computer as a drive,
so you can copy files (bug reports, scenes) without taking the card out. Leave it with
overdub, then the CHOMPI key.

## Going back to stock firmware

1. Delete `FRIZZ.bin` from the card.
2. Copy back your backup, or a factory card from
   [`reference/firmware/card-profiles/`](reference/firmware/card-profiles/) (also in
   [CHOMPI Club's repo](https://github.com/CHOMPI-Club/CHOMPI/tree/main/firmware/card-profiles)): `tape-2.0/`,
   `tempo-1.0/` or `wave-1.0/`. Copy the folder's *contents* to the top folder of the card.
   Each one includes its firmware `.bin`.
3. Switch on and wait for the rainbow pattern to finish.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No rainbow, the old firmware starts | Check that `FRIZZ.bin` is in the top folder, that it's the only `.bin` there, and that the card is FAT32 |
| Rainbow, but then nothing works | Copy `FRIZZ.bin` to the card again (the copy may be damaged) and switch on again |
| Silence | Check the input gain (press VOLUME, then turn) and the input/loop mix (SHIFT + turn VOLUME, turn towards green) |
| The CHOMPI doesn't respond at all | The bootloader may be damaged. Reinstall CHOMPI's own bootloader (`firmware/bin/CHOMPI_Bootloader_V6_2_0.bin`) as described in [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md#4-put-it-on-the-chompi), then install FRIZZ again. Don't install the generic Daisy bootloader instead |
