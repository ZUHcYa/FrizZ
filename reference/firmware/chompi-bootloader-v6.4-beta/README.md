# CHOMPI — Bootloader v6.4 (beta)

The internal bootloader for **CHOMPI**. It runs as soon as the Daisy receives power, installs new 
application firmware from the SD card or over DFU, and starts the application.

This v6.4 bootloader never actually shipped on units (which used the original **v6.2** bootloader),
but was created to improve the stability of the Daisy Seed's integration with CHOMPI's hardware... 
so it's technically still considered a BETA.

---

## What this is

CHOMPI's original v6.2 bootloader was forked from the [Electrosmith Daisy Bootloader](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyBootloader)
around their v6.0 timeline. This new v6.4 version
adds CHOMPI's hardware-specific code onto Electrosmith's **v6.4** source and the libDaisy QSPI driver
it builds against, which restores the flash chip's status register at start-up.
`CHANGELOG.md` lists what changed from v6.2.

## Building

Toolchain: Arm GNU Toolchain 13.3.rel1, the one the released binary was built with.

```bash
CHOMPI_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/path/to/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1/bin ./build-bootloader.sh
```

A correct build is byte-identical to the release: chompi_bootloader_v6_4.bin, 119,612 bytes,
md5 580b187fec405849fb401eb699281e4c.

## Installing

The SD-card update never touches the bootloader; it lives in the processor's internal flash.
Install it over DFU (BOOT held while the Daisy powers up) or with an ST-Link, at `0x08000000`:

```bash
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D bootloader/build/chompi_bootloader_v6_4.bin -d ,0483:df11
```

## Repository layout

```
